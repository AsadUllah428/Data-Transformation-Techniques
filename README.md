This repository demonstrates various data transformation techniques commonly used in machine learning and data preprocessing. The goal is to showcase how to apply these transformations to improve model performance or meet algorithmic assumptions. Included techniques:

Normalization and Standardization
Scaling to Minimum and Maximum Values
Scaling to Median and Quantiles
Gaussian Transformation
Logarithmic Transformation
Reciprocal Transformation
Square Root Transformation
Exponential Transformation
Box-Cox Transformation
RobustScaler
Each transformation is implemented with clear explanations and examples, helping you understand how to adjust your data for better analysis and modeling.
